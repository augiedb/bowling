# Bowling

## Description

This is a coding kata that took too long to score a bowling game.

Will ultimately take a list of rolls and spit out the score.  User can enter "X", "/", or a number.  Bowling.final_score(that_list_of_rolls) will return the score.

## TO DO

Everything. Naming needs an overhaul. Refactoring will also be needed to simplify some data structures.

Also, can I get it to work if I disallow "X" and "/" and require only numbers? Might be a good variation.

## Version 1: Just Happy to Get It Done

This is the version I wrote just to get it done.  It was completely test driven and I tried not to think too far ahead of myself, which might explain why I spend so much time passing a list containing a tuple and another list all the time.  Just weird.
